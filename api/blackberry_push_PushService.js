/**
* @namespace The <code>PushService</code> object allows you to leverage the BlackBerry push architecture to receive push data in your application. 
* The push solution includes a push-enabled application on a BlackBerry device and a content provider's server-side application (also known as the Push Initiator). 
* The Push Initiator can deliver up to 8 kB of content (images, text, etc.) and headers (metadata name-value pairs) using a Push Proxy Gateway (PPG). 
* <br/><br/>
* Two PPGs are available: the public/BlackBerry Internet Service (BIS) PPG and the enterprise/Blackberry Enterprise Server (BES) PPG. The <code>PushService</code>
* object will allow your application to receive push messages sent through either of these PPGs.
* <br/><br/>
* To work with a <code>PushService</code> object, you must first call the static <code>create</code> function.  On a successful create, you will then be able
* to perform operations using the <code>PushService</code> object you receive in the success callback.
* @toc {Push} PushService 
* @class The <code>PushService</code> object allows you to perform all the push-related operations.

/**
* <p>
* Creates a <code>PushService</code> object.  The <code>PushService</code> object will only be available if the <code>successCallback</code> function is called.
* It will not be available if the <code>failCallback</code> function is called instead.
* </p>
* @param {Object} options Object literal that allows the user to specify various options.
* @param {String} options.invokeTargetId Your application's unique invoke target ID, as set in your config.xml, related to when a new push notification 
* is received and the application needs to be invoked.
* @param {String} [options.appId] The provider application ID. If writing a consumer application, this corresponds to the application ID you received after registering 
* to use the public/BIS PPG push service.  If writing an enterprise application, you have the choice of not specifying <code>appId</code> 
* (in which case a unique one will be generated for you under the covers) or specifying a unique value of your choosing (this second option is useful if you plan
* to subscribe with the Push Initiator in your application).  
* @param {String} [options.ppgUrl] The PPG URL to register with.  If writing a consumer application, you will be provided with this URL after registering to 
* use the public/BIS PPG push service.  The URL will point to either the eval or the production environment (for eval, http://cp{cpid}.pushapi.eval.blackberry.com; 
* for production, http://cp{cpid}.pushapi.na.blackberry.com where {cpid} is replaced with your content provider ID).  If writing an enterprise application, 
* no <code>ppgUrl</code> value should be specified.
* @callback {function} successCallback The callback that is invoked when the <code>create</code> operation is successful.
* @callback {PushService} successCallback.pushService The <code>PushService</code> object that can be used on a successful <code>create</code> operation.
* @callback {function} failCallback The callback that is invoked when the <code>create</code> operation has failed.
* @callback {Number} failCallback.result The reason for the failure. See the constants provided to see what result codes apply for this operation.
* @callback {function} simChangeCallback The callback that is invoked when a SIM card change has occurred.  This callback only applies on a successful create.  
* When a SIM card change occurs, the channel will automatically be destroyed since this scenario may indicate the possibility of a new user using the device. 
* Care should be taken by the application to handle this situation as well. For example, the application may wish to re-authenticate the user with the Push Initiator 
* (if your Push Initiator implementation supports subscription) and then re-create the channel using <code>createChannel</code>. 
* @callback {function} pushTransportReadyCallback The callback that is invoked after a create channel or destroy operation has failed with a result error code of
* either <code>PUSH_TRANSPORT_UNAVAILABLE</code> or <code>PPG_SERVER_ERROR</code> and the network/push transport/PPG is now available again.
* @callback {Number} pushTransportReadyCallback.lastFailedOperation The last operation that was performed that failed with a result error code of 
* either <code>PUSH_TRANSPORT_UNAVAILABLE</code> or <code>PPG_SERVER_ERROR</code>. It should be one of <code>CREATE_CHANNEL_OPERATION</code> or 
* <code>DESTROY_CHANNEL_OPERATION</code>.  Use this value to determine which operation should be tried again.
